# Order Processing BPMN Description

## Scope
This process models the order processing workflow for the market access system, enabling farmers to sell produce directly to buyers with automated logistics and payment handling. The process supports MIS by streamlining data flow and decision-making.

## Key Entities and Roles
- **Farmer**: Lists available produce and confirms orders.
- **Buyer**: Browses produce, places orders, and makes payments.
- **Logistics Provider**: Manages delivery scheduling and tracking.
- **System Admin**: Oversees system operations and resolves disputes.
- **Database**: Stores and processes all transaction data.

## BPMN Diagram Overview
- **Swimlanes**: Separate lanes for Farmer, Buyer, Logistics Provider, System Admin, and Database.
- **Flow**:
  1. **Start Event**: Buyer initiates the process by browsing produce.
  2. **Task (Buyer)**: Buyer places an order.
  3. **Gateway (Decision)**: System checks produce availability.
  4. **Task (Farmer)**: Farmer confirms order if stock is available.
  5. **Task (Database)**: Order is recorded, and payment is processed.
  6. **Task (Logistics)**: Delivery is scheduled and tracked.
  7. **End Event**: Buyer receives produce, and transaction is complete.
- **Data Flows**: Order details, payment status, and delivery updates are stored and retrieved from the database.
- **Decision Points**: Availability check, payment validation, and delivery confirmation.

## MIS Alignment
- **Decision-Making**: Real-time data on stock and orders supports fair pricing and demand forecasting.
- **Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual intervention, speeding up transactions.
- **Data Integrity**: Centralized database ensures accurate records for auditing.
